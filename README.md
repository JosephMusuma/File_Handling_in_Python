# File_Handling_in_Python
The script performs the following tasks:

Creates a new text file named "my_file.txt" and writes three lines of text into it.
Reads the contents of "my_file.txt" and displays them on the console.
Appends three additional lines of text to the existing content in "my_file.txt".
Handles potential file-related exceptions using try, except, and finally blocks.
